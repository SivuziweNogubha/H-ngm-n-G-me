## Getting Started
This project is a `Java` project using `maven` as build tool.

The structure is as follow:
* `src/main/java` - in here is where all the logic for the program is contained.
* `src/test/java` - in here are unit tests for Quality Assurance

### IntelliJ
To open it in `IntelliJ` IDE:
1. _File_ -> _New_ -> _Project from Existing Sources..._
1. Choose _External Model_ as *Maven*

## Build, Test & Run
You may use IntelliJ to run your code and tests, but alternatively you can use the Maven build tool:
* First ensure you are in the root directory of the project
* To compile your code, run: `mvn compile` 
* To run the tests: `mvn test`
* To run your application: `mvn compile exec:java`
